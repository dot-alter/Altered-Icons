# Contributing to the Project
<small>8min read</small>

**Do you enjoy building your own environment üí´?** We value creative minds.

Contributing is simple: you just need to be familiar with the project‚Äôs principles, design styles, and metric systems. You can find them here:

+ [Principles ‚Üí](./01_principles.md)
+ [Design ‚Üí](./02_design.md)
+ [Metrics ‚Üí](./03_metrics.md)

If you‚Äôre already familiar with these fundamentals, it's crucial to review the **contribution terms**, **practices**, and **recommendations**.

**In this section:**

+ [Contribution practices ‚Ü¥](#-contribution-practices)
+ [Recommendations ‚Ü¥](#-recommendations)

## üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Conscious participation

By contributing, you're helping others find the material they've been looking for. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important for your collaboration to align with the project‚Äôs goals.

### How can you contribute?

1. **New icons**  
   You can create new icons by uploading an SVG file to the appropriate category. Clone the repository and submit your pull request (PR) for weekly review.

2. **Suggestions**  
   If you think a specific icon is missing, submit your idea by creating a new issue. Updates are reviewed weekly.

3. **Translations**  
   Inclusion is essential. If a language is missing, support us by contributing your own translation of the content.

Before you begin, we recommend reviewing the sections below.

## ‚õ≥ Contribution practices

If you choose to create your own icon, follow these steps to ensure your work is **valid**, **reviewable**, and **aligned** with the project:

1. ### Selection  
   Choose the topic and style of your icon (chubby or flattered) clearly. You can review this in the [basic principles ‚Üí](./01_principles.md).

2. ### Review  
   Check whether the icon you want to create already exists to avoid duplicates. See the [category list ‚Üí](../../icons/README.md).

3. ### Guides  
   If the icon doesn‚Äôt exist yet, you may begin designing. Use the grid and base shape guides. 
	+ [Key shapes ‚Üí](../../icons/material/Ai-key-shapes-cb.png)
	+ [Key shapes: circle ‚Üí](../../icons/material/Ai-key-shapes-circle-cb.png)
	+ [Key shapes: triangle ‚Üí](../../icons/material/Ai-key-shapes-triangle-cb.png)


5. ### Publishing  
   Submit a PR with your icon in SVG and PNG format (transparent background). Review the [publishing requirements ‚Ü¥](#publishing-requirements)

6. ### Approval  
   Your PR will be reviewed to ensure it meets the project standards. If it‚Äôs rejected and you believe it was a mistake, feel free to open a discussion and we‚Äôll gladly take a second look.

### Publishing requirements

+ **Chubby-style** icons must be stored in:
  - SVG: `./icons/chubby/svg/<category>`
  - PNG: `./icons/chubby/png/<category>`

+ **Flattered-style** icons must be stored in:
  - SVG: `./icons/flattered/svg/<category>`
  - PNG: `./icons/flattered/png/<category>`

+ Each icon must be added to the icon index in alphabetical order under the appropriate type and category. [View index ‚Üí](../../icons/README.md)

+ Issues, PRs, and commits must follow a specific format. Refer to the templates:


	+ [üÜï Add a new icon](../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_icon.md)
	+ [üîÄ Request an Icon](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new_icon_request.md)
	+ [üêû Bug report](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
	+ [üÜé Translation request](../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/translation_request)

## üìã Recommendations

To achieve the best results:

1. **Sketching is key**  
   Draw your ideas before digitizing them. This is especially helpful with the chubby style.

2. **Follow the guides**  
   Use the provided grids and base shapes to stay consistent with the project‚Äôs style.

3. **Ask questions**  
   If you have any doubts, open a GitHub discussion or submit an issue.

## üè∑Ô∏è Labeling system

To keep things organized and easy to follow, we use the following labels in PRs and Issues:

| Label                      | Description                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `status: pending`          | PR waiting for review                |
| `status: approved`         | PR approved and ready to merge       |
| `status: changes requested`| Changes requested from contributor   |
| `status: rejected`         | PR or Issue rejected                 |
| `type: icon`               | New icon contribution                |
| `type: translation`        | Translation contribution             |
| `type: suggestion`         | New idea or recommendation           |
| `help-wanted`              | Community assistance needed          |
| `good-first-issue`         | Great for first-time contributors    |

## üßæ Other clauses

### Icon file naming format:
```md
ai-[icon-name]-[style]
```

**Where:**

+ `ai` ‚Üí Fixed prefix for the project (Altered Icons)
+ `[icon-name]` ‚Üí Icon name in **kebab-case**
+ `[style]` ‚Üí Style suffix:
  + `cb` for **chubby**
  + `ft` for **flattered**

**Examples:**

+ Message icon (Chubby): `ai-message-box-cb.svg`  
+ Settings icon (Flattered): `ai-bald-man-ft.svg`  
+ User icon (Chubby): `ai-user-profile-cb.png`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Avoid the following:**

- ‚ùå Using spaces or capital letters: `Ai MessageBox CB.svg`
- ‚ùå Including unnecessary words or language codes: `Ai-icon-MessageBox-chubby-final.svg`
- ‚ùå Special characters: `Ai-message@box(cb).svg`

### Language

To ensure consistency and support international collaboration, **all issues, pull requests, commits, and file names (including icons)** must be written in **English**. This includes:

+ Titles and descriptions of *Issues*
+ Messages and headers in *Pull Requests*
+ Commit messages and technical comments
+ SVG/PNG filenames

> This ensures that developers from all over the world can easily understand and collaborate on the project.


### Unapproved Icons

Even if a contribution is not approved, we still value the effort behind it. If it is seen as a reference or source of inspiration, the icon will be moved to the `./icons/community-drafts/` folder.

In such cases, some publishing rules still apply: both SVG and PNG versions must be included, each stored in the appropriate subfolder within `community-drafts`.

All files in this folder will retain the contributor‚Äôs name through the repository's commit history. Icons may be revisited and refined in the future for possible approval.

See this in [unapproved Icons ‚Üí](../../icons/community-drafts/README.md)
