## üóø Concept

> **Minimalism with character.**

Altered Icons (AI) stems from the idea of combining simplicity with creativity, without sacrificing legibility or functionality. Its purpose is to communicate effectively through clear and distinctive visual forms.

This approach is designed especially for user interfaces, web systems, and desktop or mobile applications. We don‚Äôt aim to reinvent what already exists, but rather to refine and adapt it into a fresher visual proposal with a marked sense of *personality* and greater *memorability*.

AI's style is based on well-established design principles, such as those proposed by [Material Design (visit)](https://m2.material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html), applying proven conventions for building digital iconography.

## üí≠ Key Characteristics

Altered Icons are defined by a series of key visual traits. These attributes bring originality and ensure consistency across the set.

### Chubby

> Outline icons with a soft, friendly personality.

The **chubby** style is the main style of the pack. It‚Äôs based on simple, rounded, and smooth lines that give the icons a **friendly** and recognizable appearance.

It‚Äôs not just about rounded corners ‚Äî the strokes are neither perfectly straight nor entirely circular, but rather strike a balanced flow. This design line is referred to as *genetically altered icons*.

### Semi-Fill

> Partially filled icons for added visual contrast.

Some **chubby** icons include internal fills, but without being fully solid. This design choice is used in scenarios where:

+ A fully outlined version of the icon already exists.
+ Visual contrast is needed within a UI.
+ Internal fill improves consistency across the icon family.

### Flattered

> A simplified, flat variant for broader usage contexts.

The **flattered** style removes the soft curvature of chubby icons, opting for straight lines and a flatter aesthetic. It‚Äôs useful in more neutral environments or when a different visual direction is needed while maintaining baseline standards.

#### Difference between "Chubby" and "Flattered"

| Feature       | Chubby                                                       | Flattered                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Lines         | Slightly rounded and curved (in most cases)                 | Straight lines                                   |
| Corners       | Rounded (border-radius)                                     | Rounded (border-radius)                          |
| Fill          | Semi-fill in some icons for contrast                        | Semi-fill in some icons for contrast             |
| Grid          | `24√ó24dp`                                                   | `24√ó24dp`                                        |

## ‚òëÔ∏è Adaptability

> Designed to integrate smoothly into any digital context.

Altered Icons are built to work across diverse environments ‚Äî from websites and mobile apps to dashboards and design systems.

Thanks to their clean construction, these icons adapt efficiently to both modern platforms and custom systems. For this reason, we emphasize their value as a **core visual communication asset**.
