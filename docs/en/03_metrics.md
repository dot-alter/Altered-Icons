## „Ä∞Ô∏è Stroke

Stroke thickness is essential to maintain visual consistency and legibility at different sizes. A stroke width of `1.5dp` is applied to both curves and ends, aligned **inside** the shape.

A unique feature of Altered Icons is the **simulated independent stroke**. Instead of using a regular `1.5dp` stroke, we construct a fully custom shape that mimics the path of a line while adding visual weight and volume to it.

This technique is only used when the regular stroke does not visually match the icon style or breaks the overall composition.

## ‚Ü™Ô∏è Corners

Corner measurements are based on the `24√ó24dp` grid. For square, rectangular, or triangular shapes, a corner radius of `2dp` is applied.

For circular shapes (which are not always perfect circles), a radius of `4dp` is used at the corners, and the curves are adjusted to form the desired circle‚Äîfollowing the base circle reference from the grid.

When it comes to stroke volume, the outer edge extends up to `1dp`.
