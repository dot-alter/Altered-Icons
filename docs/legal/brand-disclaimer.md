# Brand Icons Disclaimer  
### Altered Icons – Artistic Interpretations of Registered Trademarks

---

## Introduction  
Some icons included in the **Altered Icons** library may represent **artistic interpretations inspired by well-known brands or logos**.  
These icons are incorporated solely for illustrative, educational, cultural, or visual compatibility purposes within the AI design ecosystem.

Altered Icons **does not aim to replicate, replace, or officially represent** these brands. Each design maintains the project's characteristic aesthetic, coherence, and visual style without faithfully reproducing distinctive elements of the original logos.

---

## Policy Scope  
This policy applies to any icon within Altered Icons that:  
- Directly or indirectly references a brand, product, service, or technology.  
- Contains `"brand"` tags in its metadata.  
<!--
- Is listed in the official registry `/docs/brands/registry.json`.  
-->

---

## Guiding Principles  

1. **Artistic Interpretation, Not Reproduction**  
   Each logo-based icon is a **stylized reinterpretation** created to integrate into Altered Icons' unified visual language, without fully representing any brand entity.

2. **Visual and Conceptual Differentiation**  
   Logo-inspired icons are intentionally designed to **avoid direct similarity or confusion** with official logos.

3. **Independence and Neutrality**  
   Altered Icons is an independent project. It is not necessarily affiliated with, sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with any of the entities, corporations, or owners of the brand interpretations referenced.

## Legal Disclaimer  

> **Altered Icons** acknowledges the intellectual property rights of all trademarks and logos that may be directly or indirectly referenced, always represented interpretively rather than imitatively.  
>  
> Brand-themed icons:  
> - Do not constitute official representations of original logos.  
> - Should not be used as substitutes for legitimate logos of any entity or product.  
> - Do not necessarily imply affiliation, sponsorship, endorsement, or commercial relationship with any original brands.  
> - Altered Icons is not responsible for the use, application, or practices carried out by end users who utilize Altered Icons material.  
>  
> Each icon is a **derivative work of artistic nature**, subject to the project's general license [(see LICENSE.md)](../../LICENSE.md) and operating under fair use principles in visual and educational contexts.

## Usage Recommendations  

- **Recommended Use:**  
  - Interfaces, mockups, or design materials requiring visual consistency without literal brand representation.
  - Webs, applications or design systems that do not prioritize referencing third-party brands.
  - Personal brands or projects that do not seek to reference other brands.

- **Inappropriate Use Considerations:**  
  - Officially presenting or replacing the entire visual identity of a registered trademark.
  - Commercial applications that seek to appropriate existing brand identity using Altered Icons material, or that may mislead about non-existent affiliation or sponsorship.  

> These policies do not override the official status of the [Altered Icons license](../../LICENSE.md), which is legally governed by its own [terms](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC) stating that _"Use, modification, and redistribution of the icons is permitted under the terms of said license (ISC)"_ with applicable disclaimers established in this document.

---

## Maintenance and Review  
- Icons with `"brand"` tags will be periodically reviewed to ensure compliance with visual differentiation standards.  
- Upon receiving takedown requests or claims from rights holders, Altered Icons **will promptly consider to remove or modify** the corresponding icon.
