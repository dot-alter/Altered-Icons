## 🌐 Why another icon library?

We believe that simplicity does not have to be boring.

Altered Icons was created on the belief that functional design can also be expressive, innovative, and enjoyable.

That is why we decided to begin this project with a clear personality and philosophy 🥊. 

We're inspired by initiatives like **Streamline Icons Flex*, but **AI** (Altered Icons) has its own distinct aesthetic. **Our goal is not to replace, but rather to provide an alternative**. And of course, offer a creative, **free**, and **open-source** alternative.
