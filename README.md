## 🌐 Why another icon library?

We believe that simplicity does not have to be boring.

Altered Icons was created on the belief that functional design can also be expressive, innovative, and enjoyable.

That is why we decided to begin this project with a clear personality 🥊. It is more than just another icon collection; it is a proposal with a distinct visual identity and philosophy.

We're inspired by initiatives like *Lucide Icons* and systems like *Material Design*, but Altered Icons has its own distinct aesthetic. **Our goal is not to replace, but rather to provide an alternative**.
