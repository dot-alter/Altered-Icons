# BRAND ICONS POLICY

---

## Introduction  
Altered Icons may include **stylized icons that represent artistic interpretations of well-known logos, products, or brands**, always within a framework that respects intellectual property rights.

This initiative aims to **provide broader visual and contextual coverage** across design, development, art, culture, recreation, entertainment, education, and documentation—without engaging in improper use of trademarks or infringing on third-party rights.

Icons that allude to brands, products, or technologies are integrated into the Altered Icons ecosystem only when they comply with the principles outlined in this policy and the corresponding legal disclaimer:  
[`docs/legal/brand-disclaimer.md`](docs/legal/brand-disclaimer.md)

## Contributing

Before proposing or uploading a brand-themed icon, ensure you follow these steps:

1. **Conscious Design**  
   - The icon must align with the set's characteristic aesthetic and style (line weight, fill, curvature, proportions).  
   - Avoid replicating letters or typography that are distinctive elements of a brand or logo.

2. **Proper Identification**  
   - Add `"brand"` to the `"tags"` field in the corresponding JSON file.  
   - Include additional descriptive tags as relevant (e.g., `"web"`, `"app"`, `"tech"`, etc.).

3. **Naming**  
   - If the icon artistically represents a widely recognized identity by name, use that name for the `.svg` and `.json` files, unless a more appropriate descriptive alternative exists.  
     - Examples: `video-player`, `thread`, `face-letter`, `link-in`.  
   - Names may also reflect artistic interpretations that evoke the icon's essence.

<!--
4. **Documentation**  
   - Register the icon in `/docs/brands/registry.json` with its name, style, and source of inspiration.  
   - If the icon is based on a new brand not yet registered, open a *pull request* for its inclusion in the registry.  
-->

### Validation
   - Brand-themed icons will undergo manual review by the project's review team or maintainers before final inclusion.  
   - In case of conflict or doubt, public feedback from the community sourcing material directly from AI sources will guide the final action—or, alternatively, the review team's decision will prevail.
